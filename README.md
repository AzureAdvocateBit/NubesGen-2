## 1-minute introduction to NubesGen

With NubesGen, going to production on Azure is one `git push` away!

NubesGen is a Web application that generates a cloud infrastructure using Terraform: you select easy-to-understand options ("a MySQL database", "an application server"), and it'll generate a state-of-the-art configuration that you can import and tweak in your project.

## 5-minutes introduction to NubesGen

Terraform and Azure look complicated to you?

With Nubesgen, we have simplified the way to production: you answer some easy-to-understand options ("a MySQL database", "an application server"), so you don't need to spend hours looking at the technical documentation.

NubesGen generates a Terraform configuration that is hand-made by Azure experts: it follows the current best practices, with a specific focus on security and scalability. We also provide budget estimates and dashboards, so you can be assured your finances will be under control.

For advanced users, this Terraform configuration can be modified and tweaked as usual: NubesGen is only here to get you started quickly!
